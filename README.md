# Edtech Market Lead Scoring Prediction
Developing a machine learning model for an ed tech company to predict the propensity of buying a course based on the lead information details such as number of calls by salesperson etc.

## Overview

This project was designed to assist the sales division of our client, an Ed-Tech company. Our primary objective was to develop a predictive analytics model that could effectively identify the propensity of buying a course after the marketing team has generated leads from a group of potential buyers of the educational courses offered by the company.
